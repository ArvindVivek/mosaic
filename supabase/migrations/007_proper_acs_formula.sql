-- Implement proper VALORANT ACS (Average Combat Score) formula
--
-- ACS = (damage + kill_points + multikill_bonus + non_damaging_assists*25) / rounds_played
--
-- Kill Points by enemies alive when kill happens:
--   5 enemies alive: 150 points
--   4 enemies alive: 130 points
--   3 enemies alive: 110 points
--   2 enemies alive: 90 points
--   1 enemy alive: 70 points
--
-- Multikill Bonus: +50 points for each additional kill within 3 seconds
--
-- Non-damaging assists: 25 points each

-- =============================================================================
-- Materialized View: Pre-calculated round ACS for performance
-- This calculates the combat score for each player in each round using:
-- - Damage dealt
-- - Kill points based on enemies remaining
-- - Multikill bonuses for kills within 3 seconds
