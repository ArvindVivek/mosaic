/**
 * The bundled match data. Mosaic's database was deleted after the hackathon, so every page and
 * API route reads this fixture instead: 32 VCT Americas playoff series (2024-2025) rebuilt from
 * GRID's event logs by lumina/scripts/fixtures/build-fixtures.mjs (shared with Lumina).
 *
 * Read with fs rather than `import`, so TypeScript never type-checks a 2 MB JSON literal and the
 * data isn't copied into every route's bundle (next.config.ts traces the file into each function).
